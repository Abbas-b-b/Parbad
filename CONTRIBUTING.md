### Pull Requests

  You would like to join the Parbad development and send a Pull Request? Then please read the bellow instructions:

- First create an [issue](https://github.com/Sina-Soltani/Parbad/issues/new/choose) and explain what your Pull Request is for. Maybe you don't need to do anything at all! If everything goes right after the discussion then continue the following steps.
- Create a new branch from the `master` branch.
  - Branch name pattern: `[feature|bug]/[issue number]_[name]`
  - Branch name examples: `feature/70_AddingSomething`, `bug/80_FixingSomething`
- Codes MUST be human readable. If you don't know how search for:
  - Clean Code
  - C# Naming Convention
- Codes (Interfaces, Classes, Methods, Properties, etc.) that are `public` MUST have a summary.
- Don't use 3rd party libraries which are not popular.
- Let people know how your feature works by writing a nice and understandable Wiki guidline. This will be added in [Wiki](https://github.com/Sina-Soltani/Parbad/wiki) page.
